Get Started For customers with ATM/Debit/Credit Card Frequently Asked Questions Income Q1) What should I do if my salary credit is not recognised? You can inform your company HR to use GIRO code 22 when they process the payroll/salary file to their corporate bank. Q2) If I have a joint account, how will our income transactions be recognised? The combined total salary and dividend credits in that joint account will be recognised under the individual Multiplier Accounts. Example 1: John and Mary credit their salaries (S$3,000 and S$3,100 respectively) and dividends (S$500 each) into their joint POSB savings account. They have their own Multiplier Accounts and are accorded a total income amount of S$7,100 each. Example 2: George credits his salary of S$4,000 into a joint POSB savings account shared with Emily. Emily does not have an income. They have their own Multiplier Accounts and are accorded a total income amount of S$4,000 each. Credit Card Spend Q1) What are the eligible credit card transactions? Only posted retail and cash advance transactions will be recognised as eligible credit card spend. Balance transfers, instalment payment plans, preferred payment plans, and any fees / charges imposed by the bank are not eligible. Example: Transaction date: 30 Aug Credit card spend is made at a merchant. Posting date: 1 Sep Transaction is posted to your credit card account. This transaction is therefore recognised under Septemberâs credit card spend (not August). Q2) Do I have to link my Multiplier Account to my DBS/POSB Credit Card in order for my credit card transactions to be recognised? No. Eligible credit card transactions are automatically detected across all the personal DBS/POSB Credit Cards held by you. Multiplier Account recognises credit card transactions made via American ExpressÂ® /MasterCardÂ® /Visa. Insurance Q1) I wish to change my premium payment frequency e.g. yearly to monthly or vice versa. Will my policy still be recognised for this month? In the event that there are changes to the insurance policy, the monthly premium will cease to be included as an eligible transaction. This will take effect from the month where the changes are made. Changes can include but are not limited to change in premium payment frequency and reassignment of policy ownership. Q2) I was late in paying my premium due this month. Will my policy still be recognised as eligible transaction for this month? Yes. Your policy will still be recognised as long as your policy is still in force. Q3) If my policy premium due is paid quarterly/annually, how is the transaction recognised? We will derive the monthly premium amount from dividing the annualised premiums by 12. Q4) How to check the number of eligible months that I have paid for my insurance policy? You may view the breakdown of eligible months for your insurance transaction via Bank & Earn Summary in digibank mobile. Investment Q1) If my investments are in foreign currency, how will they be recognised? Investment transactions will be recognised as the Singapore dollar equivalent at DBSâ prevailing exchange rate. Q2) If the investment amount is deducted from a joint DBS/POSB deposit account, will the transaction be recognised for both account holders? The transaction will be accorded to the investment applicant only. Q3) How to check the number of eligible months that I have paid for my investment policy? You may view the breakdown of eligible months for your investment transaction via Bank & Earn Summary in digibank mobile. DBS Invest-Saver Q1) Can I terminate my existing DBS Invest-Saver and re-purchase to be recognised? No. For the re-purchase to be recognised, the fund has to be terminated and fully redeemed for at least 6 months from the date of termination or date of full redemption, whichever is later. Alternatively, you may consider purchasing a new fund to continue recognition. Example: Termination Date 29 April Full Redemption Date 30 April Re-purchase Set Up Date Re-purchase after 30 October will be recognised Q2) I have just signed up for DBS Invest-Saver. How will it be recognised? DBS Invest-Saver will be recognised in the same month if you sign up before the deduction date, 15th of the month (or the next business day if the 15th is a Sunday or Public Holiday). Else, it will be recognised the next month. It will be recognised for the first 12 consecutive months after the free-look/cancellation period or 4 calendar days after the settlement date. Example: Deduction Date 15 April (or next business day if 15th is a Sunday or Public Holiday) Settlement Date 21 April (3 to 4 working days, depending on fund house) Recognition Date 25 April (4 calendar days after the settlement date) Q3) If I change the amount of my existing DBS Invest-Saver within the 12-month period, will it be recognised? Yes, you may update the amount and it will be recognised if deduction is successful Q4) My DBS Invest-Saver contribution is not recognised for the month. Why is that so? Recognition of the monthly contributions as eligible transactions will cease from the month where there is any failed deduction, or the DBS Invest-Saver is terminated. Online Equity Trade Q1) What transactions are ineligible for higher interest? The following transactions are ineligible: Contra trades, sell trades, and trades executed via Trading Representatives and DBS Vickers Customer Service Line. Q2) If I have an joint DBS Wealth Management Account, will the transaction be recognised for both account holders? For joint DBS Wealth Management Account, the equity trades will be recognised in full for each joint account holder under their individual DBS Multiplier Accounts. PayLah!

Non-Eligible Transactions include Peer-to-Peer (P2P) fund transfers via PayLah! message, mobile number, QR Code & Payment Link, eGift, QR Gift. Q2) I have only PayLah! Retail Spend for the month.

The combined total salary and dividend credits in that joint account will be recognised under the individual Multiplier Accounts. Example 1: John and Mary credit their salaries (S$3,000 and S$3,100 respectively) and dividends (S$500 each) into their joint POSB savings account. They have their own Multiplier Accounts and are accorded a total income amount of S$7,100 each. Example 2: George credits his salary of S$4,000 into a joint POSB savings account shared with Emily.

Insurance Q1) I wish to change my premium payment frequency e.g. yearly to monthly or vice versa. Will my policy still be recognised for this month?

Changes can include but are not limited to change in premium payment frequency and reassignment of policy ownership. Q2) I was late in paying my premium due this month. Will my policy still be recognised as eligible transaction for this month? Yes. Your policy will still be recognised as long as your policy is still in force.

I transferred funds locally to the wrong recipient. If you know the recipient, you may contact the recipient directly to request for the return of funds. If you are unable to contact the recipient, get in touch with us so we can assist to reach out to the recipient on your behalf. Please be informed that consent must be given by the recipient before funds can be returned. I received funds transferred to my account but I am unsure of the source and purpose. Do check whether you have received a notification from us regarding a wrong transfer to your account. You may get in touch with us to provide your consent for us to return the funds to the sender. We will process & return the funds to the sender within 7 working days. I provided an inaccurate account number to the sender of my funds, and the transfer has been made to the wrong account. What should we do? Inform the sender to request for his/her bank to recall the transfer. The sender will then be notified on the status of the request. As you are neither the sender nor the recipient of the funds, you will not be able to make the recall request directly. Frequently Asked Questions What shall I do if I know the recipient but I accidentally made a funds transfer to them?

We will cooperate with the law enforcement to aid in their investigations. It is an offence under the Penal Code for the recipient to retain or use the funds after being informed that it was sent by mistake.

We hope that the information provided might help to resolve your problems. Wrong account number/Wrong recipient bank chosen For FAST transfer to other banks: If your transaction history shows that the amount was debited from your account and then subsequently refunded, this might be due to you transferring funds to an invalid recipient or bank account. Therefore, you might want to check if you have keyed in the account number correctly or if you have chosen the correct bank name. Once you have verified your recipientâs bank account details, simply attempt your transfer again. Recipientâs Account is inactive For FAST transfer to other banks: If your transaction history shows that the amount was debited from your account and then subsequently refunded, this might be due to you transferring funds to an inactive account.

I recently became a Singapore Permanent Resident (PR), and would like to register my NRIC as a PayNow Proxy. What will happen to my FIN Proxy? Once you receive your blue NRIC, please proceed to the nearest DBS/POSB branch to update your NRIC in the bank's records. During the update process, your FIN Proxy will be de-registered from PayNow and your NRIC will become eligible for registration. You can subsequently register your NRIC as a PayNow Proxy, via DBS iBanking, iWealth or your digibank App."

        "content": "What are the banks participating in EDP? The participating banks are Citibank, DBS Bank, HSBC, Maybank, OCBC Singapore, Standard Chartered Bank and UOB. As the sender, can I choose a future date for EDP/EDP+ to be valid? Yes, for EDP. As the sender, you may issue a post-dated EDP to your recipient as you can select an effective date up to 6 months ahead from the creation date. For EDP+, the effective date is automatically set to one day (T+1) after the payment is created. For example, if you sent an EDP+ on 1 Jun 2025, your recipient will be able to cash it out from the next day, 2 Jun 2025 onwards. Unfortunately, you can't change this to a later date. What is the validity of my EDP / EDP+? EDP and EDP+ has a validity period of 6 months from the effective date (earliest date your recipient can cash out). Upon which, they will expire and become invalid. If your EDP/EDP+ has expired, hereâs what you can do: For senders: Issue a new EDP or EDP+ to your recipient if needed. For recipients: Reach out to your sender directly to request a new EDP or EDP+. I entered my recipientâs mobile number. Why is it showing me a different name / nickname? When finding your recipient with their mobile number, your recipientâs PayNow nickname will be returned for your review before you proceed with the issuance of the EDP."

        "content": "How would the Bank treat my case if I do not meet the Bankâs request to submit the CRS Self-Certification? The bank will determine your tax residency based on the information held in our records. If we determined that you are a tax resident in a country with which Singapore has signed an agreement to exchange financial account information, we must disclose your account information to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). In addition, IRAS requires financial Institutions to report the account information of certain non-responsive account holders. If you do not respond to your financial institutionâs request for information, IRAS may require your financial institution to treat your account as a reportable account. How do I update my tax residency status if I am below 18 years of age or do not have a valid DBS/POSB ATM or Debit Card? In the event you are below 18 years of age or do not have a valid DBS/POSB ATM or Debit Card, you can download the Self-Certification Form and; Mail to: DBS Bank Ltd - Deposits & Unsecured Lending Operations Privy Box No. 920905 Singapore 929292 (AH0011) OR Visit any POSB/DBS Branch with the completed form and your NRIC/Passport for verification. If you are a minor and below 18 years of age, Self-Certification form can be signed by the parent / trustee / guardian on your behalf. Kindly supplement your submission with the front and back copy of government-issued document to support your tax residence information (e.g. identity card, passport, employment pass/work permit or documents from tax authority showing recent filing of income tax). I received a rejection letter, what should I do now? The reason of rejection will be clearly stated in the rejection letter. Kindly take note of the necessary amendments or additional documents required and resubmit your self-certification via go.dbs.com/sg-selfcert. If we did not receive a further response from you, the bank will determine your tax residency based on the information held in our records. If we determined that you are a tax resident in a country with which Singapore has signed an agreement to exchange financial account information, we have to disclose your account information to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). How do I determine my tax residency? If you have questions on how to determine your jurisdiction of tax residence, you can: Refer to the Rules Governing Tax Residence published by the different jurisdictions for information on the respective jurisdiction's tax residency rules; Check with the tax authority of the jurisdiction which you think you may be a tax resident. (e.g. If you have stayed in Country A for more than 6 months, you can seek a confirmation from the tax authority of Country A on whether you are regarded as its tax resident for the tax year); or Consult a tax advisor. Definition of a Tax Resident Each jurisdiction has its own rules on defining a tax residency. In general, you will find that tax residence is the country/jurisdiction in which you live. Special circumstances may cause you to be a resident elsewhere or in more that one country/jurisdiction at the same time (dual residency). For more information on this, please contact your tax advisor or the information at the OECD automatic exchange of information portal. What if my contact information/residential address/passport/FIN is not updated in the bank records? You can update your personal details online. You can refer to the following step-by-step guides to: Update Mobile Number Update Residential and Mailing Address Update Personal Particulars (including Passport and FIN) My passport has been renewed and the passport number has changed. However, I have yet to update the bank records. Which passport number should I indicate? Kindly indicate the passport number that is in the bank records for the submission of the self-certification. As your passport number has changed due to the renewal, please also submit a copy of your new passport which must have a minimum validity of at least 6 months. Learn more on how you can update your passport with us. For more information on Common Reporting Standards (CRS), refer to the OECD, IRAS or the CRS Fact Sheet issued by the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS)."

        "content": "Understanding Malware and Malware Scams What is malware? Malware or âmalicious softwareâ is any software that is used to disrupt operations, gather sensitive information or gain access to a device, including a smartphone. More info from the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore can be found here. How do malware scams happen? Once a malicious application is installed, scammers can remotely access the victim's device and steal sensitive information, including personal data and banking credentials to perform fraudulent monetary transactions. How do scammers trick victims into downloading malware? Scammers employ social engineering tactics and fake advertisements on social media platforms and e-commerce websites. They often offer enticing deals for products and services. They include popular foods like durian and seafood or services like food catering, pet grooming, home cleaning and aircon maintenance. Victims are then tricked into clicking on a web link to download an app that is not from the official Google Play or Apple App Store. What happens when your device is infected with malware? When the malware app is installed, scammers will have access to control your device remotely and may use this ability to steal your personal and banking credentials. They can even log in to your digibank and perform fund transfers without your knowledge. What are some tell-tale signs that your device may be infected with malware? Device is operating slower than usual Apps are taking longer to load Battery drains faster than expected Seeing a lot of pop-up ads Device has unfamiliar apps that you do not recognise Unexplained increase in data usage Higher than expected phone bills Tips to protect yourself from malware attacks Be wary of a deal that seems too good to be true Because it probably is! Scammers have been offering fake, attractive deals like extremely cheap iPhones or durians, and very low prices for services like cleaning or pet grooming. Such scams are often found in website ads, emails, text messages, or on WhatsApp. Once you click on the ad or contact the seller, you may be asked to download unfamiliar, harmful apps to make payment. Thatâs how your device gets infected with malware. Stick to official sources like Google Play and Apple App Store When downloading mobile apps, only use trusted sources like the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. These app stores have measures in place to reduce your risk of installing harmful apps. Even on official stores, always check the descriptions, reviews and ratings of apps to make sure they're trustworthy. Avoid downloading apps from third-party websites, emails, text messages, or social media! Pay attention to app permissions and use mobile security software Whenever an app you install asks for permissions, take a moment. If it asks for accessibility permissions, full control over your device, or access to sensitive information like your text messages and emails that it does not need, it could be a warning sign of a malicious threat. For example, a shopping app should not be asking for access to your contact list, camera or photos. Such permissions can allow a scammer to get full control of your device. Consider using reputable mobile security software to protect your device. Such software can help detect and block any harmful apps and alert you to potential risks. Make use of your security features today! To strengthen your digibank security, knowing what tools you have to protect yourself is crucial. Take precautions Personal Particulars Update: Keep your contact details updated to get timely alerts and detect fraudulent transactions early. Transaction Alerts: Set alerts on your bank accounts and debit or credit cards to be notified of transactions. Transfer Limits: Set lower daily transfer limits in digibank to limit your exposure to fraudulent transactions. In case of fraud, act fast! Payment Controls (for your card): Review your card transactions regularly. If you notice anything unauthorised, use Payment Controls to block your debit or credit card immediately and call us. Safety Switch (for your account): Suspect a scam attack on your account? Activate our Safety Switch to suspend access to your funds and self-service banking facilities quickly. DBS Fraud Reporting Hotline: Call the DBS fraud hotline at 1800 339 6963 from Singapore or (65) 6339 6963 from Overseas to report any fraudulent transactions."

    "full_text": "Cooling Period for selected digibank transactions We're constantly enhancing our security measures to keep your account safe from the rising threat of scams. Important information A 12-hour cooling period will be progressively implemented for the following selected digital banking services, such as: Adding a new transfer recipient Increasing daily local & overseas transfer limits Updating contact details (email, mobile number) With this 12-hour cooling period, it gives you a window to detect and report any suspicious activity if anyone tries to make unauthorised changes to your account. You will be able to transfer funds to the new transfer recipient or up to your new transfer limits, only after the cooling period is over. For application of new banking products and services, you may wish to proceed after the cooling period is over so that updated contact and address details will be reflected. Here are some tips for seamless banking Pre-plan your transfers If you anticipate needing to add a new transfer recipient, or increase your limits, do so at least a day in advance. Note: In line with MAS and IMDAâs Shared Responsibility Framework, we are constantly enhancing our fraud monitoring system to safeguard your savings more effectively. Keeping your money safe against scams is our top priority. Some transactions may be delayed by up to 24 hours, allowing you time to cancel the transfer if it is unauthorised. We appreciate your understanding and encourage you to plan your payments in advance to avoid any disruptions. Review your limits regularly Keep your transfer limits low to minimise potential losses in case of unauthorised access. Keep your contact and address details updated Your contact and address details are essential as they allow us to communicate important information and send you alerts on unauthorised transactions via letter, SMS or email. Please update your details timely to ensure you receive these timely alerts. Frequently Asked Questions Why do I need to wait 12 hours before my transactions take effect? Keeping your money safe against scams is our top priority. The 12-hour cooling period is a critical security feature designed to give you time to detect and stop unauthorised activity on your account. For instance, if a scammer attempts to add a new transfer recipient or increase your transfer limits, transfers to new recipients or transactions above your existing limits will only be allowed after the 12-hour cooling period has ended. During this time, alerts will be sent to your bank registered contact details so you can review the request and report it immediately if it was not made by you. Can I opt out of this security feature? No. With the rise in scams, this is a regulatory security feature that has been put in place to safeguard your banking accounts and monies. What activities will trigger a 12-hour cooling period?

This reduces the risk of your password and account being compromised. If youâre setting up a new PIN or password, avoid words, phrases or sequences that are easily guessed. That rules out using your birthdate or phone number as a PIN. Depending on your mobile device, technologies such as TouchID and facial recognition can help authenticate you securely.

    "title": "About Shared Responsibility Framework (SRF)",
    "category": "General - Fraud Prevention",
    "full_text": "About Shared Responsibility Framework (SRF) Digital scams are evolving rapidly, causing financial losses and undermining trust in online banking. To strengthen protections and promote shared accountability, Monetary Authority of Singapore and Infocomm Media Development Authority have introduced the Shared Responsibility Framework (SRF). Starting from 16 December 2024, this framework clarifies how banks like us and customers like you can work together to prevent and address phishing scams together. Note: In line with MAS and IMDAâs Shared Responsibility Framework, we are constantly enhancing our fraud monitoring system to safeguard your savings more effectively. Keeping your money safe against scams is our top priority. Some transactions may be delayed by up to 24 hours, allowing you time to cancel the transfer if it is unauthorised. We appreciate your understanding and encourage you to plan your payments in advance to avoid any disruptions. The Shared Responsibility Framework applies to scams that exploit a three-step process: The Trick The Trap The Theft Scammer impersonates a legitimate entity that offers services to Singapore residents (e.g. government organisations, banks). Customer clicks on link provided by the scammer through digital messaging platform (e.g. SMS) and enters his account credentials onto the fabricated digital platform (e.g. fake website). Scammer uses customerâs account credentials to take over his account and perform unauthorised transaction(s). Frequently Asked Questions What types of accounts does the SRF cover? The SRF applies to protected accounts. These are Personal Banking accounts (e.g. SAYE account, Multiplier account, PayLah!) that can be used for electronic payment transactions. What should I do if I suspect I am a victim of a scam? Contact your bank immediately through their official channels (not links received in suspicious messages). Report the incident and provide all relevant information, including any communication with the scammer, police report, and transaction details. Responsible Financial Institution (RFI) and Responsible Telco Responsibilities What are the responsibilities of my bank (Responsible FI) under the SRF? At DBS, we maintain robust security measures to protect your accounts. Our responsibilities under the SRF are crucial in determining the sharing of responsibility for losses from seemingly authorised transactions. Specifically: Cooling-off Period: We enforce a minimum 12-hour cooling-off period after security token activation or logins from new devices, restricting high-risk activities (adding payees, increasing limits, disabling notifications, changing contact info). Real-time Alerts for High-Risk Activities: We provide real-time alerts for all high-risk activities (adding payees, increasing limits, updating particulars, disabling alerts) as defined in the SRF. Real-time Outgoing Transaction Notifications: We provide real-time notifications for all outgoing transactions. 24/7 Reporting Channel and Safety Switch: We offer a 24/7 reporting channel, including a \"Safety Switch\" â a self-service feature allowing you to promptly block mobile and online access to your account if you suspect you are a victim of a scam. For all scam report, please call our fraud hotline at 1800 339 6963 or (65) 6339 6963 from overseas. Enhanced Real-time fraud surveillance (effective 16 June 2025): We will progressively enhance our round-the-clock monitoring system to better detect and mitigate cases of consumersâ accounts having material sums being rapidly wiped out by unauthorised transactions in a phishing scam. You may experience some delays or additional security checks as a result, but we assure you this is a necessary step to enhance your online safety. DBS will bear the losses resulting from our failure to comply with the SRF duties. What are the responsibilities of my telecommunication company (Responsible Telco) under the SRF? Connect only to authorised aggregators# for delivery of Sender ID SMS: Telcos should only deliver Sender ID SMS to their subscribers if it is received from approved sources. Block Sender ID SMS from non-authorised aggregators: Telcos should block Sender ID SMS from unapproved sources. Implement anti-scam filter: Telcos should filter and block SMS containing malicious URLs that match those in a database designated for Telcos to refer to. #Authorised aggregators are licensed by IMDA to send SMS that bears a Sender ID with an alphanumeric sender ID, or a short code registered with the Singapore SMS Sender ID Registry. The list of authorised aggregators can be found on SGNICâs website at https://sgnic.sg/smsregistry/list-of-participating-aggregators. How will the responsibility for losses be determined? If a loss occurs due to a seemingly authorised transaction, DBS, along with your telecommunications company (if applicable), will conduct an investigation to determine if all our responsibilities under the SRF were met. Based on this investigation, we will determine who will bear the loss. DBS is committed to fulfilling our obligations. If the investigation shows we failed to meet our responsibilities, DBS will cover the loss. If the investigation determines that DBS acted in accordance with our duties, then the responsibility for the loss will be assessed according to the SRF guidelines. What are other ways I can use to protect my money from scammers? There are various security features and tools you can use to strengthen your account security. Update your contact details: Ensure you receive timely alerts from us by updating your contact details to stay informed and protected. Lock your money with digiVault: Just as a lock protects your valuables, digiVault protects your money by preventing scammers from performing unauthorised transactions. Complete your Security Checkup: Spend a minute on your digibank app to complete your recommended security actions and strengthen your banking defences. Review your transfer limits: Protect your account from large, unauthorised transactions by reviewing and adjusting your transaction limits. Was this information useful?
